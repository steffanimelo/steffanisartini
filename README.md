- 👋 Hi, I'm @steffanisartini.
- 👀 To begin with, I'm interested in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I'm looking forward to absorbing as much knowledge as possible from you all.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning the basics of HTML and CSS, and I'm also very excited to interact with the Web community.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate with future projects in a user experience interface; combining my soft and technical skills will make me the best professional I want to be.
- 📫 Please feel free to contact me through LinkedIn via @steffanimelo.
